Now, it's time to get together to meet, participate in a service learning activity together, and brainstorm next steps for the next school year. And we'll watch the video, and eat!</p>

	<h3>Break Free - Anacortes</h3>
<p>Here in the Pacific Northwest, we are converging on March Point in Anacortes, WA, whose refineries produce nearly half of all the gas and diesel consumed in our region, and where Shell Oil is proposing to add a new facility that would even increase crude oil train traffic on the Columbia River.This is a time to say No. Together, with one voice, all over the world. NO to fossil fuels. Yes to our common humanity. Yes to a sustainable human future. We will not sell out our future and our children’s future to our fossil fuel addiction.
This is what BREAK FREE means.</p>

<p>You don’t have to get arrested. But if you know yourself to be a citizen of the world, and if you have a stake in the future, even just a sentimental one …. Please put in an appearance. Hosted by many organizations, including 350PDX.org.</p>
